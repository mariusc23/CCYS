A plugin for managing the display of widgets on a page by page basis. Using widgets as a post type.

== Description ==

Widget Wrangler is a plugin for Wordpress that gives administrators a clean interface for managing widgets on a page by page basis.

Widget Wrangler provides widgets as a post type, gives you the ability to use existing wordpress widgets (called 'Cloning'), and provides shortcode support for individual widgets.

Create and manage multiple sidebars (groups of widgets) per page.
It's similar to Drupal Blocks, but on every page, with the ability to set the default location of the widgets in specific sidebars.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `widget-wrangler` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Add a new sidebar under the Widget Wrangler Sidebars menu item
1. Begin adding widgets under the Widget Wrangler Add New menu
1. Set default widgets on the Widget Wrangler Set Defaults page
1. (Sidebar Display Option A) Add the function 'ww_dynamic_sidebar('sidebar_slug');' to your page templates. Normally, you will want to replace the existing 'dynamic_sidebar()' function with this one.
1. (Sidebar Display Option B) If you don't want to edit your template files, you can add a Widget Wrangler Sidebar to your existing sidebars by using the WW Sidebar widget in the Wordpress Widget area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display a single widget within a Page's content? =

Widget Wrangler comes with built in shortcode support for each widget.  To show a single widget in a content area, use the shortcode pattern of [ww_widget id={post_id}].
ie. [ww_widget id=240] where 240 is the post_id of the widget.

= How do I find out a widget's post ID? =

A widget's post ID is displayed in the 'Options' panel when editing that widget.

= How do I display my widgets? =

There are two ways to accomplish this.   The easiest way is to go to the standard Widget area under the Appearance admin menu item and drag the WW Sidebar widget into the sidebar area where it should appear, then select which WW sidebar should be shown from the widget options.
The other way requires you to edit your template files and find any instance of the dynamic_sidebar() function.  Replace these functions with ww_dynamic_sidebar('name_of_sidebar').

= How can I control the widget's template (HTML)? =

In the widget-wrangler directory there is a file named 'widget-template.php'.  Copy this file to your theme's root directory and rename it 'widget.php'.  You can edit the HTML in the file to have widgets defaultly appear as you want.
To template specific widgets, save a copy of widget-template.php as widget-[widget ID].php in your theme directory. (eg. widget-121.php, where 121 is the widget's ID)

= Can I use existing wordpress widgets? =

Mostly. Widgets designed for Wordpress 3+ are able to be used with the 'Clone WP Widget' option in the Widget Wrangler menu.  Widgets programmed for older versions of wordpress may not work.

= What does it mean to Clone a widget? =

When you Clone a wordpress widget, it creates a new widget post in the Widget Wrangler system with the settings for the original wordpress widget pre-filled in the Advanced Parsing area of the new widget.
